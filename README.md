## Important Question - Interview 
* Clone Graph
* Clone LinkedList using random pointer.
* Clone a Binary Search Tree using random pointer.
* Questions based on modification of Dijikstra's algorithm - Flight Discount CSES
* Finding K shortest Routes in a graph problem - Modified Dijikstra
* Classical Problems of DP - LPS
* Longest Flight Route - DP on Graphs (Topo sort with DP)

### Important Graph Algorithms -
* BFS
* DFS
* Dijkstra's Algorithm - SSSP
* Floydd Warshall  - ASSP
* Bellman-Ford - Negative Edge shortest path
* Kahn's Algorithm - Topological Sorting
* Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) - Connected Componets, Cycle detection
* Kruskal's Algorithm - MST
* Kosaraju's Algorithm - Strongly connected componets in directed graph
* Eulerian path and circuit.
* Hamiltonian path and circuit. 
* Graph Coloring - Bipartite check and 4 color theorem based problems.

### Important DP concepts
* Seletion problems, i.e, selecting one and leaving another. Ex - Choosing the Judge(Hackerearth), Boredom(Codeforces)
* 2D DP problems -> where state change is dependent on two variables Ex - Vacation(Codeforces)
* DP on strings - Usually we create 2D dp for such problems. 
* Minimax Algorthim problems
* Bitmask dp - used in assignment problems
* DP on trees - Diameter of a tree, no of paths of lenght k in a tree
* DP on trees - Uniqe structred BST for given N (print the trees and the numbers too) - numbers can be found using catalan's number.
